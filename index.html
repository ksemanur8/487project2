                Studio Ghibli was founded in 1985 in Tokyo by Isao Takahata
                (screenwriter, director, producer), Toshio Suzuki (producer),
                and Hayao Miyazaki (animator, director, producer, screenwriter,
                author, manga artist). The name Studio Ghibli was based on the
                Arabic name for "hot sahara wind" because the founders wanted
                Studio Ghibli to blow new wind through the anime industry.
                <br /><br />
                At the time of Studio Ghibli's founding, anime was looked down
                upon in the film industry. The breakthrough for Studio Ghibli
                was in 1989 with the movie Kiki's Delivery Service. After this
                Miyazaki and producer Suzuki continued to make many more hits
                after Kiki.
                <br /><br />
                Studio Ghibli films continue to be beloved by children and
                adults alike for many reasons including the art style,
                non-stereotypical characters, and the way they combine magic
                with realism.

                Studio Ghibli has consistently created the most compelling
                animated films around, in part due to their immersive realism.
                Despite the fantasy and magic, Ghibli's films consistently feel
                tactile and realistic.
                <br />
                To quote Miyazaki: “Anime may depict fictional worlds, but I
                nonetheless believe that at its core it must have a certain
                realism. Even if the world depicted is a lie, the trick is to
                make it seem as real as possible. Stated another way, the
                animator must fabricate a lie that seems so real viewers will
                think the world depicted might possibly exist.” — Starting
                Point, p. 21
                <br />
                Consider Ghibli’s approach to animating movement. Watch how
                their characters run and interact with their environment, how
                their clothes and hair move — the illusion of physics. Animators
                must construct a sense of scale, gravity, weight, and momentum
                from frame to frame, to emulate the semblance of a physical
                world where there isn’t one. This trait isn’t unique to Ghibli’s
                films, but they consistently achieve a realistic, tactile,
                effortless sense of realism through their approach to movement.
                This helps ground us within the reality of the film world, even
                if that world is far removed from our own.
