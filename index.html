                Studio Ghibli was founded in 1985 in Tokyo by Isao Takahata
                (screenwriter, director, producer), Toshio Suzuki (producer),
                and Hayao Miyazaki (animator, director, producer, screenwriter,
                author, manga artist). The name Studio Ghibli was based on the
                Arabic name for "hot sahara wind" because the founders wanted
                Studio Ghibli to blow new wind through the anime industry.
                <br /><br />
                At the time of Studio Ghibli's founding, anime was looked down
                upon in the film industry. The breakthrough for Studio Ghibli
                was in 1989 with the movie Kiki's Delivery Service. After this
                Miyazaki and producer Suzuki continued to make many more hits
                after Kiki.
                <br /><br />
                Studio Ghibli films continue to be beloved by children and
                adults alike for many reasons including the art style,
                non-stereotypical characters, and the way they combine magic
                with realism.
