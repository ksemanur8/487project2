                Studio Ghibli was founded in 1985 in Tokyo by Isao Takahata
                (screenwriter, director, producer), Toshio Suzuki (producer),
                and Hayao Miyazaki (animator, director, producer, screenwriter,
                author, manga artist). The name Studio Ghibli was based on the
                Arabic name for "hot sahara wind" because the founders wanted
                Studio Ghibli to blow new wind through the anime industry.
                <br /><br />
                At the time of Studio Ghibli's founding, anime was looked down
                upon in the film industry. The breakthrough for Studio Ghibli
                was in 1989 with the movie Kiki's Delivery Service. After this
                Miyazaki and producer Suzuki continued to make many more hits
                after Kiki.
                <br /><br />
                Studio Ghibli films continue to be beloved by children and
                adults alike for many reasons including the art style,
                non-stereotypical characters, and the way they combine magic
                with realism.

            <div class="cont-inner display-flex">
              <p class="inner-text">
                <!--Source: https://asherkaye.medium.com/the-immersive-realism-of-studio-ghibli-cc51d552dc4a-->
                Studio Ghibli has consistently created the most compelling
                animated films around, in part due to their immersive realism.
                Despite the fantasy and magic, Ghibli's films consistently feel
                tactile and realistic.
                <br />
                To quote Miyazaki: “Anime may depict fictional worlds, but I
                nonetheless believe that at its core it must have a certain
                realism. Even if the world depicted is a lie, the trick is to
                make it seem as real as possible. Stated another way, the
                animator must fabricate a lie that seems so real viewers will
                think the world depicted might possibly exist.” — Starting
                Point, p. 21
                <br />
                Consider Ghibli’s approach to animating movement. Watch how
                their characters run and interact with their environment, how
                their clothes and hair move — the illusion of physics. Animators
                must construct a sense of scale, gravity, weight, and momentum
                from frame to frame, to emulate the semblance of a physical
                world where there isn’t one. This trait isn’t unique to Ghibli’s
                films, but they consistently achieve a realistic, tactile,
                effortless sense of realism through their approach to movement.
                This helps ground us within the reality of the film world, even
                if that world is far removed from our own.

            <h2>Natsukashii</h2>
            <div class="cont-inner display-flex">

                https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20200119-a-uniquely-japanese-take-on-nostalgia-->
                "Natsukashii is a Japanese word used when something evokes a
                fond memory from your past. It’s a word you exclaim as a smile
                creeps across your face. For instance, when you hear a song you
                loved as a teenager, or when you come across an old train ticket
                stub in your pocket."
                <br /><br />
                Studio Ghibli has fans of all ages and this is partly due to the
                concept of natsukashii.
                <br /><br />
                Studio Ghibli films are able to evoke nostalgia in global
                audiences too. This is explained as follows: "The Ghibli-brand
                world is not conservative or traditionalist in the sense of
                embracing Japanese traditions or promoting Japaneseness. In
                stylistic terms, it tends toward a sort of cozy European kitsch
                with environmentalist undertones, typified in the numerous
                technologically and culturally eclectic burgs in Miyazaki’s
                films with their beatific openness to sea, sky, and greenery –
                pan-bourgeois neopastoralism. If there is a community implicit
                in the Ghibli-brand address to the world, it is one full of
                ambivalent fascination for traditions in general, for other
                worlds and other futures "

            <div class="cont-inner display-flex">
              <p class="inner-text">

                Good character development is crucial for any fictional story.
                Studio Ghibli excels at making relatable and believable
                characters. The art of storytelling requires the following:
                <br /><br />
                "In fiction writing, character development is the process of
                building a unique, three-dimensional character with depth,
                personality, and clear motivations. Character development can
                also refer to the changes a character undergoes over the course
                of a story as a result of their actions and experiences."
                <br /><br />
                Studio Ghibli's films contain characters with hardships, flaws,
                hobbies, and livelihoods. In Kiki’s Delivery Service, viewers
                relate to the main character Kiki because of her drive to leave
                her hometown in order to become her own person, which directly
                implies elements of young adulthood.
                <br /><br />
                Studio Ghibli's characters also excel at being
                non-stereotypical. For most of their films, young girls lead the
                story line with the narrative slowly building them to be a
                heroine. This effort allows us to look at characters like Kiki
                (Kiki’s Delivery Service), Chihiro (Spirited Away), Haru (The
                Cat Returns), Sophie (Howl’s Moving Castle), and San (Princess
                Mononoke), just to name a few, in a relatable sense.
